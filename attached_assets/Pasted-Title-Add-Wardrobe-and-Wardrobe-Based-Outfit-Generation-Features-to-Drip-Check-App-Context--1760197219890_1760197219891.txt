Title: Add ‚ÄúWardrobe‚Äù and ‚ÄúWardrobe-Based Outfit Generation‚Äù Features to Drip Check App

üîç Context

We are building an outfit recommendation app called Drip Check using React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MySQL for the database.

Currently, the app functions as a marketplace-based outfit generator:

On the homepage, users can search for clothing items from the marketplace.

When they select an item (for example, a topwear), the app generates a complete outfit by suggesting other matching items (like bottomwear and footwear) from the marketplace.

We now want to add a Wardrobe feature that allows users to store their own clothing items and generate outfits based only on their personal wardrobe instead of marketplace items.

üß© Goal

To expand Drip Check by adding two major capabilities:

A Wardrobe System where users can add, view, edit, and manage their own clothing items.

A Wardrobe-Based Outfit Generator that creates complete outfit recommendations using only the items saved in a user‚Äôs wardrobe.

üëï Feature 1: Personal Wardrobe System

Purpose:
Allow each registered user to upload and manage their personal clothing collection within the app.

Requirements:

Add a dedicated ‚ÄúWardrobe‚Äù page accessible from the main navigation.

On this page, users should be able to:

Upload an image of each clothing item they own.

Categorize the item (for example: topwear, bottomwear, footwear, or accessories).

Add optional details such as color, brand, size, material, or tags.

Display all items in a clean, visually organized grid or list format.

Include options to edit or delete any item.

Provide filtering or sorting options so users can view items by category.

Each wardrobe should be unique to the logged-in user.

Expected Experience:
The wardrobe should feel like a personal digital closet where the user can browse all their items with images and details, easily manage them, and prepare to generate outfits using only those items.

üëó Feature 2: Outfit Generation Using Wardrobe Items

Purpose:
Enable users to generate complete outfits that are composed entirely of their own wardrobe items.

Requirements:

Allow users to switch between two modes within the app:

Marketplace Mode (default): Generates outfits from marketplace items.

Wardrobe Mode: Generates outfits using only wardrobe items.

In wardrobe mode, when a user selects one clothing item (for example, a topwear), the system should generate complementary outfit suggestions using other items from their wardrobe.

The generated outfit should visually display a complete look ‚Äî showing the selected base item along with matching items from other categories.

Ensure the experience is consistent with the marketplace outfit generation flow, so it feels like part of the same system.

The wardrobe-based generation logic should focus on realistic styling combinations (e.g., pairing topwear with bottomwear and footwear).

Include an easy way for users to toggle back to marketplace mode if they wish to explore marketplace recommendations again.

Expected Experience:
Users can seamlessly switch between browsing outfits from the global marketplace and creating looks using their own personal items, making Drip Check both a shopping and personal styling tool.

üß† Functional Expectations

Maintain the same UI style, tone, and flow as existing Drip Check components.

The wardrobe and outfit generation experiences should be smooth, intuitive, and integrated within the app‚Äôs existing layout and navigation.

The system should recognize whether the user is in marketplace or wardrobe mode at all times.

Data for each user‚Äôs wardrobe should be stored securely and linked to their profile.

Users should feel like they are managing their own virtual closet ‚Äî and the outfit generator should intelligently use only the items they‚Äôve added when in wardrobe mode.

üéØ Final Deliverables

A fully functional Wardrobe section where users can upload and manage their personal items.

A Wardrobe-based outfit recommendation flow that generates looks from user-added wardrobe items.

A simple toggle or control to switch between Marketplace and Wardrobe modes.

Consistent user interface and experience across both modes.

Proper integration with the existing Drip Check app structure and user accounts.
