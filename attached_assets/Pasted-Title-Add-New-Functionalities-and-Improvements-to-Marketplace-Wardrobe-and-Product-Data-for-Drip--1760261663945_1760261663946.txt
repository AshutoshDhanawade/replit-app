Title: Add New Functionalities and Improvements to Marketplace, Wardrobe, and Product Data for Drip Check

üîç Context

Drip Check is an outfit recommendation app where users can discover clothing items, generate outfit bundles, and manage their personal wardrobe.

The app currently includes:

A Marketplace with searchable clothing items and outfit bundle generation.

A Wardrobe where users can upload and manage personal clothing items.

Outfit generation flows that show matching combinations from either marketplace items or the wardrobe.

We now want to refine some existing features and introduce a few new capabilities for a smoother, more realistic experience.

üõçÔ∏è Marketplace Page Updates

Bundle Card Enhancement

Each bundle card displayed on the Marketplace page should visually include images of all three products that make up that bundle.

The goal is to help users immediately see the full outfit combination (e.g., topwear, bottomwear, and footwear) in one compact view.

Add to Wardrobe Feature

Allow users to add individual marketplace products or entire bundles directly to their wardrobe.

This helps users collect and save looks or items they like from the marketplace into their personal closet, making it easy to later generate wardrobe-based outfits using them.

Improved Search Experience (Live Search Suggestions)

When a user types into the marketplace search bar, the system should display live suggestions in a dropdown list directly below the search bar.

Each suggestion in the dropdown should include the product name and thumbnail image for quick identification.

As the user continues typing, the list should dynamically update with more relevant results.

Clicking on a result should take the user directly to that product or its detailed view.

üîé Marketplace Search Results Page

Filter Functionality Enhancement

Currently, filters might apply automatically. We want to change this behavior.

Add an ‚ÄúApply‚Äù button for the filters on the marketplace search results page.

The filters (like category, price range, color, brand, etc.) should only be applied after the user clicks the ‚ÄúApply‚Äù button.

This ensures the user can select multiple filters first, then apply them all together in one go.

üëï Wardrobe Page Updates

Default Wardrobe View

When a user opens their wardrobe, the default view should display only the clothing items that they have added ‚Äî shown in a simple list format with thumbnails and category details.

This keeps the wardrobe clean and focused on the user's own collection.

Wardrobe Bundle Display

When a user clicks on a specific item in their wardrobe, the app should show only the wardrobe bundles related to that selected item.

These wardrobe bundles should be composed exclusively of items from the user‚Äôs wardrobe (no marketplace items).

For example, if the user clicks on a topwear item, the app should show bundles that include that topwear along with matching bottomwear and footwear items from their wardrobe.

üßæ Extra Data Setup

Sample Product Dataset for Marketplace

Add a set of at least 25 sample products to the marketplace database so that the interface feels full and realistic.

Each product should include an image, category (topwear, bottomwear, footwear, etc.), and basic attributes like color, brand, and type.

The goal is to visually populate the app and provide a better sense of how the marketplace and bundles will look with more data.
